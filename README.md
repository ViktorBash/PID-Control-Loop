# PID-Control-Loop
This is a PID control loop made in Python and simulated in MATLAB for thrust vector control.

### Workflow:
The PID controller is in PID.py. The test for the PID is in test_pid.py. Controller.py will call PID and interact with it in order to connect a raspberry Pi and a gyroscope to the PID controller.
